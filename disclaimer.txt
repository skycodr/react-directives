 * This is an attempt to replicate *ngIf, *ngFor the React way. This also eliminates
 * the need for the multi level ternaries and map function. Key prop is automatically
 * injected where necessary.
 * 
 * Disclaimer:
 * 
 * This is runtime rendered content. Thus, will have minor performance degradation.
 * If you want compile time rendered content look for other libraries. Use at your
 * own risk.
